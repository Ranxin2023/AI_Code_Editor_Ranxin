# AI Code Editor


## About
[**Judge0 IDE**](https://ide.judge0.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.

Judge0 IDE is using [**Judge0**](https://ce.judge0.com) for executing the user's source code.

Visit https://ide.judge0.com, and enjoy happy coding. :)

## Objective
This project aims to take the foundational features of the Judge0 IDE and extend its capabilities with AI-powered functionalities, transforming it into an intelligent code editor. By integrating AI, the enhanced editor offers:
    - Real-time autocomplete suggestions to assist with typing and coding efficiency.
    - An AI Chat Assistant to provide contextual help, explanations, and debugging suggestions.
    - The ability to select and analyze code snippets, allowing users to interact with specific sections of their code for focused assistance.
    - Automated suggestions to fix compilation errors, enabling faster debugging and more efficient development.

## Background
Judge0 IDE is an open-source online code editor and compiler that supports multiple programming languages. It offers developers a platform to write, run, and debug code directly in their browsers without needing local setup. Its core functionalities include:
    - A powerful and versatile Monaco Editor for code editing.
    - Language support for popular programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and more.
    - An API-driven approach for code execution and compilation.

## Features
1. Fix Compilation Errors:
- Automatically detects errors during code compilation and provides specific suggestions to resolve them.
- How It Meets the Requirement:
    - If the user's code doesn't compile, the system identifies errors and sends them to the AI backend.
    - The AI backend analyzes the error messages and suggests actionable fixes, helping users resolve issues quickly.

2. Autocomplete Suggestions:
- While the user types queries or code-related questions in the chat, the editor provides real-time suggestions to complete their input.
- How It Meets the Requirement:
    - Implements real-time autocomplete suggestions using the backend API, making it easier for users to formulate queries or code snippets.
    - This dynamic feature enhances productivity and aligns with the requirement of improving the user experience.

3. Code Selection and Contextual Help:
- Users can highlight specific blocks of code within the editor.
- Once selected, a floating chatbox appears, allowing users to ask questions specific to the highlighted code (e.g., "How can I optimize this code?").
- How It Meets the Requirement:
    - Allows users to select specific code segments and receive inline AI assistance.
    - Provides contextual help based on the highlighted code, meeting the requirement of inline interaction with selected code.

4. AI Chat Assistant:
- The AI assistant is capable of answering coding-related queries, explaining algorithms, and providing debugging suggestions.
- How It Meets the Requirement:
    - Adds a chat interface where users can ask questions and receive AI-generated responses.
    - Integrates seamlessly with the editor, allowing users to interact without switching contexts.

## Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Project
### Why Use LLMs?
    - LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT or similar models are highly proficient at understanding natural language and generating contextually relevant responses.
    - They can analyze code, explain concepts, and provide debugging suggestions based on context.

### How LLMs Are Integrated
1. Error Analysis:
    - User’s code compilation errors are sent to the backend.
    - The LLM analyzes error messages and provides specific fixes.
2. Autocomplete Suggestions:
    - When a user types in the chat, the LLM predicts the most relevant completions dynamically.
    - Suggestions are fetched from the LLM through an API, ensuring they are contextually accurate.
3. Code Context and Explanation:
    - The user highlights a block of code in the editor.
    - The highlighted code and user query are sent to the LLM.
    - The LLM provides a detailed explanation or optimization tips for the selected code.
4. AI Chat Assistant:
    - Users can ask general programming questions.
    - The LLM generates answers that are specific, detailed, and context-aware.

### Why LLMs Enhance the Project
- Context-Aware Responses:
    - LLMs use the user’s input, highlighted code, and error context to provide precise solutions.
- Improved Productivity:
    - Automates repetitive debugging and research tasks, enabling developers to focus on creative problem-solving.
- Dynamic Learning:
    - Helps users learn by offering detailed explanations of code and concepts.

## How you start the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ranxin2023/AI_Code_Editor_Ranxin
```
2. install all the dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
3. running the frontend

```

4. run the backend
```sh
node server.js
```

## Key APIs
### Overview

The backend of this project powers the AI-enhanced code editor by providing various APIs for processing, compilation, and intelligent suggestions. These APIs are designed to handle user interactions, compile code, and provide autocomplete suggestions and AI-powered feedback seamlessly.
1. Compilation API
    - Endpoint: `POST /compile`
    - **Purpose**: Compiles the user's code and returns the results, including error messages if the compilation fails.
    - How It Works:
        - Receives the user’s code and associated parameters.
        - Executes the code using a sandboxed compiler or interpreter.
        - Captures any errors and outputs and returns them to the frontend.
    
2. Autocomplete API
    - Endpoint: `POST /autocomplete`
    - **Purpose**: Provides suggestions as the user types in the chat or code editor.
    - How It Works:
        - Matches the user’s partial input with pre-defined or dynamically generated suggestions.
        - Returns the most relevant suggestions for display in the frontend.
    
3. Chat API
    - Endpoint: `POST /chat`
    - **Purpose**: Processes user questions and provides AI-generated responses using an integrated AI model.
    - How It Works:
        - Processes the user’s message, optionally including a selected code snippet.
        - Sends the message to an AI engine for contextual understanding and response generation.
        - Returns the AI’s reply to the frontend for display.
